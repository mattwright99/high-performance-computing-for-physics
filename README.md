# High Performance Computing in Engineering Physics
My work for the course ENPH 479: High Performance Computing in Engineering Physics.

The coures consists of 6 Problem Sets that apply different numerical analysis techniques to various physical systems, most of which do not have an anlytical solution. Most assignments are also paired with a research-style Latex report (named `report.pdf`) to present and discuss the results. The problem sets are as follows:

- [Problem set 1](https://github.com/mattwright99/high-performance-computing-for-physics/tree/main/ps1): *Extreme Nonlinear Optics: Dynamics of Coupled ODEs using RK4*
- [Problem set 2](https://github.com/mattwright99/high-performance-computing-for-physics/tree/main/ps2): *Simple Harmonic Oscillators and Planar Three-Body Dynamics*
- [Problem set 3](https://github.com/mattwright99/high-performance-computing-for-physics/tree/main/ps3): *Time-Dependent SchrÂ¨odinger Equation using the Space Discretized Leapfrog Technique*
- [Problem set 4](https://github.com/mattwright99/high-performance-computing-for-physics/tree/main/ps4): *CAC, MPI, Parallelized Heat Equation, SLURM*
- [Problem set 5](https://github.com/mattwright99/high-performance-computing-for-physics/tree/main/ps5): *FDTD, absorbing BC, total-field scattered-field, FDTD with flux density, frequency-dependent media, Drude and Lorentz models, Z-transform,  2d FDTD, transverse magnetic, `Numba`, Slicing, and MPI*

Huge thanks to [Professor Steven Hughes](https://www.queensu.ca/physics/hughes-group/) and the TAs, Sofia and Zhimu, for an amazing course and the thoughtful design of the assignments.
